# Shopping Cart

1. Introduction

 - In this project, weâ€™ll build a shopping cart application using HTML, CSS JavaScript 
  (which means no external libraries or frameworks). The goal is to understand the  
  mechanics of a shopping cart system.

2. Project Overview

   - Our shopping cart will simulate a clothing store. Each product card will include an image, title, description, price, and quantity options. Users can add or remove items from the cart, and the total bill will be calculated.
